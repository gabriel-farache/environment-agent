# Design Decisions: Environment Agent

### DD-010: Hybrid SP model (embedded + external)

**Decision:** The agent supports both embedded SPs (compiled into the binary,
enabled via configuration) and external SPs (standalone processes registering via
REST).

**Rationale:** Embedded SPs provide low-latency in-process communication for
well-known service types (container, cluster, kubevirt). External SPs provide
extensibility for third-party or custom service types without modifying the agent
binary.

### DD-020: One SP per service type

**Decision:** Only one SP may serve a given service type per agent instance.

**Rationale:** Simplifies routing logic — no SP selection strategy needed. The
first SP to register claims the slot. Future iterations may support multiple SPs
per service type with selection strategies.

### DD-030: Messaging system for creation requests (pull model)

**Decision:** DCM publishes creation requests to a messaging system topic; the
agent pulls work from the topic rather than receiving direct REST calls.

**Rationale:** Removes the need for DCM-to-environment inbound connectivity for
creation requests. The agent initiates all connections outbound. Aligns with
Kubernetes-style pull-based reconciliation. Also provides inherent durability
and buffering during agent restarts.

### DD-040: Three-state health model for SPs

**Decision:** SP health uses Ready / Unhealthy / Unavailable states with
different routing behaviors for each.

**Rationale:** Differentiating Unhealthy from Unavailable avoids registration
flapping. An Unhealthy SP may recover quickly; removing and re-adding the
service type for transient issues would cause unnecessary load on DCM and
policies. Unavailable means the SP is gone and the service type should be
de-advertised.

### DD-050: Retry topic for unhealthy SP requests

**Decision:** When an SP is Unhealthy, requests are held in a dedicated retry
topic rather than rejected immediately.

**Rationale:** Gives the SP time to recover without losing requests. Requests
are processed event-driven (on SP recovery or unavailability transition), not
polled periodically. This avoids busy-waiting while ensuring prompt processing
when the SP recovers.

### DD-060: Cancel topic and deny list

**Decision:** DCM can cancel creation requests that have been re-routed to a
different agent, using a cancel topic and an in-memory deny list.

**Rationale:** Prevents stale creation requests from being processed after DCM
has re-evaluated and routed to a different agent. The deny list is rebuilt from
the cancel topic on startup. The double-crash risk (agent acknowledges cancel
then crashes before filtering the creation) is accepted — SP idempotent creation
is the final safety net.

### DD-070: Deterministic topic name

**Decision:** The main topic name is deterministic — either derived from the
agent's name or provided via configuration — ensuring reuse across restarts.

**Rationale:** Guarantees that unconsumed messages are not lost on restart. The
agent reconnects to the same topic and resumes processing. Also ensures DCM's
reference to the topic (from registration) remains valid.

**Related requirements:** REQ-MSG-010, REQ-MSG-040

### DD-080: Local persistence for SP registrations

**Decision:** SP registrations are persisted to local storage so that slot
ownership survives restarts.

**Rationale:** Without persistence, an agent restart would lose knowledge of
external SP registrations. External SPs that re-register would eventually
recover, but there would be a window where the agent incorrectly allows
embedded SPs to claim slots that belong to external SPs. Local persistence
closes this gap.

### DD-090: Pod conditions as non-fatal feature

**Decision:** Pod condition updates are best-effort. If the agent cannot update
pod conditions (running outside K8s, missing RBAC), it logs a warning and
continues.

**Rationale:** The agent must operate in multiple deployment modes (standalone,
Docker, Kubernetes). Pod conditions are a convenience feature for K8s
environments and should not block agent operation in other environments.

**Related requirements:** REQ-HMN-270

### DD-100: Heartbeat-based agent liveness (REST, not messaging)

**Decision:** The agent reports liveness to DCM via REST heartbeats rather than
through the messaging system.

**Rationale:** The messaging system is used for resource operations. Using a
separate channel (REST) for liveness provides independent failure detection —
if the messaging system is down, DCM can still determine whether the agent is
alive. The agent already has outbound REST connectivity to DCM for registration.

**Related requirements:** REQ-DCM-140

### DD-120: Enhancement doc v1 vs v1alpha1 API version

**Decision:** The enhancement document references `/api/v1/` endpoints as the
target stable API. The current implementation uses `/api/v1alpha1/` as we are in
the alpha phase. This is intentional — the enhancement describes the GA target;
the implementation reflects current maturity.

**Rationale:** v1alpha1 signals to consumers that the API contract may change.
The enhancement is a forward-looking design document, not a snapshot of the
current implementation. When the API stabilizes, routes will migrate to v1 and
the enhancement will reflect the implementation.

### DD-130: Non-strict handler pattern (v1alpha1)

**Decision:** Use `HandlerWithOptions` with `server.Unimplemented{}` for Topic 1
instead of the peer-standard `NewStrictHandlerWithOptions` pattern. Migrate to
strict handlers when Topic 2 (Health Service) or Topic 3 (SP Registration)
introduces real handler implementations.

**Rationale:** Strict handlers require typed request/response structs that don't
yet exist for stub endpoints. The non-strict pattern is simpler for Topic 1's
placeholder handlers. All 4 peer repos use strict handlers — alignment will
happen when real handlers are implemented.

### DD-140: Constructor lifecycle alignment to peer pattern

**Decision:** Align the HTTP server constructor to the dcm-project peer pattern:
`New(cfg, logger, handler)` + `Run(ctx, ln)` where the listener is passed at
runtime, not at construction time. This matches all 4 active peer repos.

**Rationale:** Keeping constructor pure (no I/O resources) and passing the
listener at runtime boundary improves testability and cross-repo consistency.
`Addr()` reads from a field set during `Run()`. Tests that previously passed the
listener to `New()` are updated to pass it to `Run()` instead.

### DD-150: Timeout middleware wall-clock limitation (v1alpha1)

**Decision:** Accept that the sync timeout middleware does not bound wall-clock
response time for handlers that ignore `ctx.Done()`. Document as known v1alpha1
limitation. When Topic 8 (SP Forwarding) adds real external HTTP calls, evaluate
whether goroutine+select timeout is needed.

**Rationale:** The sync approach calls `next.ServeHTTP()` and only checks
deadline after the handler returns. If a handler ignores context cancellation,
the client is held until the handler finishes. For v1alpha1, all handlers are
stub/placeholder and the risk is theoretical. The per-request timeout AC
(AC-HTTP-095) is satisfied for context-aware handlers.
